# 2048 Game!

### About
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.

### How to play:
Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!
